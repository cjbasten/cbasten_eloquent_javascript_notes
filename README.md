Notes for https://eloquentjavascript.net/

## Chapter 1
- Uses number instead of int
- String interpolation is called template literals

- There is only one value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself, and that is NaN (“not a number”)
- NaN is meant to denote the result of a nonsensical computation

- When an operator is applied to the “wrong” type of value, JavaScript will quietly convert that value to the type it needs, using a set of rules that often aren’t what you want or expect. This is called type coercion
